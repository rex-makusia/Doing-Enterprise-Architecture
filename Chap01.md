# The Quest of Effectiveness

1. How do we make our organizations more effective?
   
2. How do we help our organizations get better at achieving their desired outcomes in a fast-changing world?

3. And before that, how do we get better at identifying what “effective” and “better” and “desired-outcomes” will mean in our own business-context?

**Things work better when they work together, on purpose.**

As enterprise-architects, it’s our task to help people make sense of all of that complexity, and make the choices needed to keep everything working together, better, on-purpose.

- “Information-systems architecture,” including IT-based processes, applications, and data
- “Infrastructure-architecture,” including computers, networks, and other physical IT-hardware

To avert that kind of risk, we need a whole-
of-enterprise architecture that is able to cover a much broader scope, as shown in Figure 1-2.
