# The Quest of Effectiveness

1. How do we make our organizations more effective?
   
2. How do we help our organizations get better at achieving their desired outcomes in a fast-changing world?

3. And before that, how do we get better at identifying what “effective” and “better” and “desired-outcomes” will mean in our own business-context?

**Things work better when they work together, on purpose.**
