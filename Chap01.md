# The Quest of Effectiveness

1. How do we make our organizations more effective?
   
2. How do we help our organizations get better at achieving their desired outcomes in a fast-changing world?

3. And before that, how do we get better at identifying what “effective” and “better” and “desired-outcomes” will mean in our own business-context?

**Things work better when they work together, on purpose.**

As enterprise-architects, it’s our task to help people make sense of all of that complexity, and make the choices needed to keep everything working together, better, on-purpose.
enterprise-architecture. As shown in Figure 1-1, most current enterprise-architecture methods and frameworks are set up to focus mainly on IT:
- “Business-architecture,” the business-context for IT
- “Information-systems architecture,” including IT-based processes, applications, and data
- “Infrastructure-architecture,” including computers, networks, and other physical IT-hardware

To avert that kind of risk, we need a whole-
of-enterprise architecture that is able to cover a much broader scope, as shown in Figure 1-2.

For example, the airport’s architecture will need to include
- Its IT and other internal services to address each type of transaction, direct-interaction, and indirect-interaction
- Its transactions such as passenger check-in, security-screening, departure, arrival, baggage-handling, passenger-information, and waiting-areas on landside and airside, and all of the equivalents on the freight-handling side of the airport.
- Its direct-interactions with recruiters, equipment-manufacturers, service-providers, regulators, and more
- Its indirect-interactions with other stakeholders in the overall enterprise, such as employees’ families, local communities, and government as a whole

In short, in a whole-enterprise-architecture, we develop an architecture for an organization such as our airport, about everything within the shared-enterprise that provides its broader context.

## An Architecture for Enterprise-Architecture

What kind of architecture would we need for that whole-enterprise-architecture itself? How would it work? What kind of structure would it need: its principles, frameworks, methods, and so on?
To answer that, let’s look at the airport in a bit more detail.
From a ***business-architecture perspective***, the airport has a very complex multi-way business-model. For example:
- Its customer-types include passengers, non-traveling visitors, freight-
handlers, airlines, and more.
- Its other ***partner-types*** include fuel-providers, maintenance-
providers, and retailers on both landside and airside who provide food and other services to passengers and visitors, and also pay rent to the airport.

From a ***regulatory-architecture*** perspective, the airport has a very complex regulatory-environment. For example:
- On the boundaries between landside and airside, the airport must verify safe-and-legal-to-send and safe-and-legal-to-receive for each passenger and flight-crew member, each item of baggage, and each item of freight.
 - The airport must ensure health-and-safety throughout the entire airport, with varying regulations applying to different places
