# The Quest of Effectiveness

1. How do we make our organizations more effective?
   
2. How do we help our organizations get better at achieving their desired outcomes in a fast-changing world?

3. And before that, how do we get better at identifying what “effective” and “better” and “desired-outcomes” will mean in our own business-context?

**Things work better when they work together, on purpose.**

As enterprise-architects, it’s our task to help people make sense of all of that complexity, and make the choices needed to keep everything working together, better, on-purpose.
enterprise-architecture. As shown in Figure 1-1, most current enterprise-architecture methods and frameworks are set up to focus mainly on IT:
- “Business-architecture,” the business-context for IT
- “Information-systems architecture,” including IT-based processes, applications, and data
- “Infrastructure-architecture,” including computers, networks, and other physical IT-hardware

To avert that kind of risk, we need a whole-
of-enterprise architecture that is able to cover a much broader scope, as shown in Figure 1-2.

For example, the airport’s architecture will need to include
- Its IT and other internal services to address each type of transaction, direct-interaction, and indirect-interaction
- Its transactions such as passenger check-in, security-screening, departure, arrival, baggage-handling, passenger-information, and waiting-areas on landside and airside, and all of the equivalents on the freight-handling side of the airport.
- Its direct-interactions with recruiters, equipment-manufacturers, service-providers, regulators, and more
- Its indirect-interactions with other stakeholders in the overall enterprise, such as employees’ families, local communities, and government as a whole

In short, in a whole-enterprise-architecture, we develop an architecture for an organization such as our airport, about everything within the shared-enterprise that provides its broader context.

## An Architecture for Enterprise-Architecture

What kind of architecture would we need for that whole-enterprise-architecture itself? How would it work? What kind of structure would it need: its principles, frameworks, methods, and so on?
To answer that, let’s look at the airport in a bit more detail.
It’s about more than just IT: We must be able to address every type of content that may be present within the overall enterprise.

As enterprise-architects, it’s our job to help others make sense of all of this complexity, and help them make decisions and take actions that will guide the whole enterprise toward ever-greater effectiveness.
How do we do that?
Classic IT-oriented enterprise-architecture gives us a good start for this. It shows us how to think architecturally, and how to use architecture frameworks, methods, tools, and checklists. It shows us how to guide architecture-driven change, from simple change-projects to large-scale business-transformations. Yet at the whole-enterprise level, there’s much more that we’ll need to address:

- ***It’s about more than just*** IT: We must be able to address every type of content that may be present within the overall enterprise.
- ***It’s about more than just a predictable world***: We must be able to address both planned and unplanned change.
- ***It’s about more than just project-delivery***: An architecture-task is fully complete only when we have finished the after-action review, and documented its benefits-realized, lessons-learned, and future actions-for-change.
- ***It’s about more than just the “happy-path”***: We must be able to address all types of events in the context, including exceptions, uniqueness-issues, failure-conditions, business-continuity and disaster recovery, load-balancing, and more.
- ***It’s about more than just a single change***: We must be able to address interdependencies, interoperability issues, gaps and overlaps between contexts, cross-context synergies, whole-of-context interactions, systems-of-systems or enterprise-of-enterprises issues, across each change, and across the enterprise as a whole.
 - ***It’s about more than just a single project or business-transformation***: We must be able to address complete lifecycles for each type of content in the enterprise, and use our longer-term sustain-
architectures to connect the work of change-projects across all of those timescales.

## Building the Architecture Capability

Before we dive into the “how-to,” we first need to summarize what we’ve seen so far about the role, purpose, and function of enterprise-architecture:
- It is a ***quality-support*** function – its role is to support the quality of effectiveness in the enterprise.
- It’s about ***effectiveness of outcomes***, for the organization, and for the enterprise as a whole.
- It acts as a ***bridge between strategy and change-management***.
- It’s about ***effectiveness of change itself***, so that every change should be “a change for the better.”
- It must be able to address ***every aspect of the enterprise*** – every scope, scale, and timescale, every type of content or context, every stage in the lifecycle of each element.
- To support ***“joined-up-ness”*** across the enterprise, the methods we use must be able to work the same way with every aspect of the enterprise, and at every stage of the change-process.

Given all of the above, we will need some kind of roadmap to plan out the sequence in which to build our capability for doing enterprise-architecture. This roadmap must cover a broader scope than most:

- The ***purpose*** of the work is to build architecture-capability to support continual improvement of effectiveness in the enterprise.
- The ***key success-criteria*** for the work are to enable the organization to respond appropriately to any type and scale of change, both planned and unplanned, and to do so with the minimum possible disruption of everyday work.
- The ***scope*** for that work is to embed that architecture-capability into the organization’s processes for change, and management of change, for use over indefinite periods of time.
- The ***context*** for the work is the entire organization – everything the organization is and does – and also some aspects of its interactions with its partners, in relation to the shared-enterprise as a whole.

What we want to achieve is that our organization can respond well to everything that the real-world might throw at it: opportunities, risks, whatever. We also need the organization to be able to do all of that in ways that are effective not just in terms of outcomes, but within itself.

Yet there’s almost no way that we’ll be able to set up all of those capabilities in one go – especially not across an organization as large as an entire airport. Instead, we’ll do it step-by-step, in smaller staged increments that build experience, competence, capability, and maturity by building on the work of the previous steps.

- We want to end up with **everyone taking responsibility for architecture**, under our guidance as required, supporting overall effectiveness in everything they do.
- To show them how to do that, we ourselves need to be able to **tackle any kind of change**, planned or unplanned, that the enterprise and wider world can throw at us – any level of complexity, uncertainty, and scale – and still keep everything on-track to purpose.
- To do that, we’ll need to **practice with unplanned change at smaller scale** – for example, the everyday uncertainties of the market.
- To do that, we first need to **have something to offer to that market** that makes sense and works well in that market.
- To support that, we must first **ensure that the underlying products and services** are always **on-purpose and effective for the need** – efficient, elegant, reliable, adapting smoothly to any change, and all working together in a unified way.
- To get there, we first need to **know what “on-purpose” and “effective” will actually mean** within our organization and its enterprise – its vision, values, constraints, success-criteria, and so on.
- To do any of that, for any organization and enterprise, we need to build a solid understanding, capability, and experience about what change is, and **how to work with change** in any way we might need.
